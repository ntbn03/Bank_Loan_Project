# Project Overview
The Bank Loan Report Project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of key loan-related metrics to monitor the bank's lending activities and assess portfolio performance. By leveraging data visualization and analysis tools, this project helps decision-makers identify trends, optimize lending strategies, and ensure better financial health for the bank.

# Key Features
•	Loan Application Analysis: Track total loan applications over time, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) comparisons.

•	Funded Amount Monitoring: Measure the total amount of funds disbursed and compare MTD and MoM changes.

•	Repayment Tracking: Analyze the total amount received from borrowers, monitoring cash flow and repayment behavior.

•	Interest Rate & DTI Analysis: Compute the average interest rate and debt-to-income ratio (DTI) to evaluate loan costs and borrower financial health.

•	Good vs. Bad Loans: Distinguish between 'Good Loans' (Fully Paid, Current) and 'Bad Loans' (Charged Off) to assess loan portfolio quality.

# Results
The project successfully delivers interactive dashboards that provide insights into key loan performance metrics, helping the bank optimize its lending strategies, improve cash flow management, and monitor loan portfolio health.
